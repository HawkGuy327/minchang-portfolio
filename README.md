Welcome to my personal portfolio — a space where I showcase the projects, tools, and creative experiments I’ve been building since the summer before my junior year.

This site includes:
- 🛠 Technical and academic projects from internships, school, and personal learning
- 🎮 A collection of fun, small apps and web-based experiments
- ✍️ Reflections on what I’m learning, trying, and struggling with
- 📄 A copy of my resume and a little about me

## 🧠 Why This Exists

I built this site to grow as a developer, reflect on what I’m learning, and share my work in a way that’s open, honest, and evolving.  
It’s also a central place to link from college applications, resumes, or future job opportunities.
